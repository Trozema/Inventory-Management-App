Web Application Documents for Inventory Management App
System Architecture:
The App will be designed using Create React App (CRA) that will connect to a MongoDB database. I will use a combination of Bootstrap and CSS styling to style the App. I have more experience working with react making it a more comfortable choice.

System Requirements:

Functional Requirements
•	The User is required to login to the app before getting access.
•	The User must be able to change the user responsible for each inventory item if they are admin.
•	The user must be able to filter inventory items.
•	The user must be able to add new inventory item.
•	The user must be able to delete an inventory item.
Non-Functional Requirements  
•	The App should display all the users options in a dropdown menu
•	The App should be highly responsive and secure.
•	The App should be reliable and available at all times.
•	The App should be mobile friendly (compatible with any device).
